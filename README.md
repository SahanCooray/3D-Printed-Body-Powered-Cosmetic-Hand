# 🦾 3D-Printed Body-Powered Cosmetic Hand for Wrist Amputees

This open-source project showcases the development of a **body-powered, 3D-printed cosmetic hand** specially designed for a **wrist-level amputee**. Our focus is to provide both **cosmetic realism** and **functional utility** for everyday tasks, using affordable, accessible technologies.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide a natural-looking cosmetic hand
- Enable basic functional activities (e.g., holding utensils)
- Ensure the brace does not restrict the user's residual limb movement
- Offer adjustability and comfort for daily wear

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Functional Grip Posture**: Mimics relaxed hand position for functional balance  
- 🔧 **Adjustable Thumb with Groove**: Designed to securely hold objects like spoons or toothbrushes  
- 🧩 **Custom Socket**: Brace was designed to **avoid interfering with wrist-level limb movement**  
- ↕️ **35° Flexion/Extension**: User-adjustable via a built-in screw system for ease of arm positioning  
- 🔒 **Velcro Strap System**: Provides adjustable, secure fitting for daily use  

---

## 🛠️ Design & Fabrication

- 🖨️ **3D Printed in PLA** for lightweight, durable construction  
- 📱 **Hand Scanning** done using the **Polycam App**, enabling a mirrored replica of the healthy hand  
- 🧷 **Assembly** included manual adjustments, mechanical screws, and ergonomic fitting for the residual limb  
- 🎨 **Aesthetic Enhancements** for a realistic appearance and better self-confidence
